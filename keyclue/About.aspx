        About The Institute</h2>
    <p>
        NIHILISM was founded in 1956 by Dr. Henry Normic in an effort to tie together 
        his archaeological observations with physical measurements. Today, researchers 
        at the Institute are foremost in the study of naturally occurring tachyon 
        emissions.</p>
    <p>
        NIHILISM is based in Calgary, Canada, and is always looking for new researchers. 
        We provide opportunities for open study and freedom to investigate one&#39;s own 
        projects.</p>
    <h2>
        About Dr. Normic</h2>
<p>
        Dr. Henry Normic was a pioneer in the field of physical archaeology. He studied 
        archaeological sites around the Calgary area, experimenting with methods never 
        attempted before. From this early research sprouted the foundation of all 
        ongoing research at NIHILISM. He was also an avid historian with a focus on 
        local Calgary culture and a marked interest in the history of the First Nations. Dr. Normic passed away in 1990, but he still lives on in 
        the research conducted at the Institute.</p>
